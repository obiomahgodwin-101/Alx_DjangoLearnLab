# Capstone Project - ALX Program

## Project Overview
This is my capstone project for the ALX program. It demonstrates the skills I have learned in Python, Django, and Django REST Framework, including API development, database design, and backend structuring.

## Project Idea
[Briefly describe your project idea here. Example: "A Book Management API that allows users to view, add, update, and delete books."]

## Objective
- To build a functional backend API.
- To design a well-structured database schema (ERD).
- To implement endpoints with filtering, searching, and ordering functionalities.

## Week 12 - Project Plan
- Outlined project objectives.
- Defined the problem being solved.
- Planned key features and API routes.
- Created a timeline for development.

## Week 13 - Design & ERD
- Created an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) to visualize database structure.
- Listed API endpoints and their HTTP methods.
- Planned relationships between models and tables.

## Next Steps
- Implement the API endpoints in Django.
- Apply permissions and authentication.
- Add filtering, searching, and ordering functionality.
- Write unit tests for all endpoints.
